In order to make this code easier to run I have provided both a makefile and a bash script to run the test cases.

To compile and run this code please follow these steps:

1. cd into the code directory
2. run make clean
3. run make
4. run chmod +x run.sh
5. run ./run.sh

This will run all 3 test cases and print the results into the command line
